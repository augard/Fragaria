This project aims to improve support for HTML Syntax Highlighting in the MGSFragaria
framework.

##The Original Project
MGSFragaria is born as a framework to provide a simple and ease to use syntax highlighting
in Cocoa applications. The original project supports a lot of the most widespread
languages and can be widely expanded, as long as languages specifications are simply
written in Plist files.

You can implement your own syntax highlighting in a few minutes.

##The Idea of this Fork
Even thought the project offers a lof of functionality, the lack of specific features
dedicated to HTML and CSS has forced me to fork the original project and try to get rid
of everything not necessary.

This fork will include only necessary stuff for HTML syntax highlighting, with particular
functions built for this language.

##Contents of this Fork
The original project contains two example applications, that demonstrate the functionalities
of the framework. I have decided to not include them in my project, to ease the package.

To learn how to get this framework working with your application, please refer to the 
original project here: <https://github.com/mugginsoft/Fragaria>.

##System Requirements
This fork is now built using ARC (Automatic Reference Counting). This requires your project to
be ARC compliant and linked against Mac OS X 10.7 SDKs or later. In other words, your
application will run on the following machines:

Any Mac with an Intel 64bit-capable processor
Mac OS X 10.7 or later installed
